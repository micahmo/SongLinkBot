# SongLinkBot
SongLinkBot is a Telegram bot that listens for song links and finds corresponding links for the same song on other music services.

## Usage

Add [@mdmSongLinkBot](https://t.me/mdmSongLinkBot) to your chats. When it detects a song link from either Spotify or YouTube Music, it sends a message to the chat with corresponding links to the other service. It also includes a link to the song's landing page on [song.link](https://song.link), which includes many other services.
